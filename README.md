Use Azure Scheduler to call an Automation Runbook
=================================================

            

 

 

This runbook configures a new or existing Azure Scheduler job that calls an Automation runbook. This enables more advanced scheduling capabilities within Azure Scheduler to be used to trigger runbooks that are not enabled in the current Automation scheduler
 functionality.


 


The scheduler job that is created is disabled so you can change the scheduler properties to meet your specific needs after it is created or updated.


        
    
TechNet gallery is retiring! This script was migrated from TechNet script center to GitHub by Microsoft Azure Automation product group. All the Script Center fields like Rating, RatingCount and DownloadCount have been carried over to Github as-is for the migrated scripts only. Note : The Script Center fields will not be applicable for the new repositories created in Github & hence those fields will not show up for new Github repositories.
